            <p>What makes decesive moments decesive? The live scenerio at that moment or the audience?</p>

            <p>"To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, </p>
            <p>of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organization of forms</p>
            <p>which give that event its proper expression.”--Henri Cartier-Bresson</p>
            
          <p>I was obsessed to these kind of ambiguity between the photography and the audience.</p>
            <p>Normally, people see the photography first and react to it.But what would happened </p>
            <p>if we reversely let the audience's emotional expression decide what they will
            look at?</p>
            
            <p>I want to combine old version of ml5's expression detection and three.js together, to see
            what would happen if we reverse the process.</p>
