What makes decesive moments decesive? The live scenerio at that moment or the audience?

"To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, 
of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organization of forms
 which give that event its proper expression.‚Äù--Henri Cartier-Bresson

I was obsessed to these kind of ambiguity between the photography and the audience.
Normally, people see the photography first and react to it.But what would happened 
if we reversely let the audience's emotional expression decide what they will
look at?

I want to combine old version of ml5's expression detection and three.js together, to see
what would happen if we reverse the process.(Haven't finished yet)
